</header>
<div>
  <p>Jaxs is the <em>best</em> dog in the land. As an <strong>11-year-old</strong> <a href="http://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Jack-Russell-Terrier/Personality.aspx" target="_blank"> Jack Russell Terrier</a>, Jaxs enjoys solving mysteries, marking territory and hunting squirrels. Jaxs is not only the <em>best</em> dog, he is also the smartest. As such, he is very, very loved.

      <h2>The Country Shmoop</h2>
  <p><span>
   <span style="font-size: 18px; color: #12BEAD">
  Jaxs was born on a farm in Virginia</span> and spent most of his early years in the greater Richmond area. Living on a pond, most of Jaxs' days were spent
  swimming, kyacking and lounging about outside.
  </p>
  <h2>The City Shmoop </h2>
  <p>Realizing the country was too easy, Jaxs realized he needed more. He began hearing of something called "the city." He didn't know what it was, but knew it was calling to him.

  <h3><h3 style="text-align: center;">Beacon Hill</h3>
  <p>At six years old, Jaxs began exploring broader pastures. He first moved to Boston, where he became a true city pup. In Boston, he became known as King of the Common and fell for his first true love, Charlie.

<h3><h3 style="text-align: center;">Jamaica Plain</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, things with Charlie ultimately went south, and Jaxs decided to explore the suburbs, moving to Jamaica Plain. JP brought new opportunities, as well as new challenges. Most memorably, Jaxs became an avid off-leasher during this period.
  </p>
    <h3><h3 style="text-align: center;">Brooklyn</h3>
  <p>As great as JP was, it was never far enough for Jaxs to escape the memory of Charlie's scent. Jaxs ultimately decided to move to New York City. Jaxs chose an apartment in Brooklyn Heights, a small but cozy place. In Brooklyn, Jaxs discovered the wonders of convenience: convenient parks, convenient lunch locations and conveniently located food on every sidewalk. Jaxs' life was finally perfect.
